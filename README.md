install neccessary modules - angular, nodejs, mongoDB (+robo3T would help if new to mongoDB) etc, and run npm init to install others
populate mongo DB with some dummy data if you want using robo3T, I will change the db schemas soon, below is a dummy text: { "title": "Fil", "responsible": "Home", "description": "In", "severity": "Out", "status": "hello" }

rooomatesv6/backend terminal - npm run dev

roommatesv6/frontend terminal - ng serve -o
