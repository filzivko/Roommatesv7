Roommatesv6

Set Up:

Install neccessary modules - angular, nodejs, mongoDB (+robo3T would help if new to mongoDB) etc, and run npm init to install others

Populate mongo DB with some dummy data if you want using robo3T, I will change the db schemas soon, below is a dummy text: { "title": "Fil", "responsible": "Home", "description": "In", "severity": "Out", "status": "hello" }

To Run:
Using terminal, navigate to the below two locations and run the respective commands

rooomatesv6/backend - npm run dev

roommatesv6/frontend - ng serve -o
