# Roommates Web App
## Version 0.7.0

This is an MVP version of a web app which allows users to declare their location (home, away or sleeping) to their roommates.
This is my second time building a full stack application using MEAN.
(MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js) [MEAN stack explination](https://www.mongodb.com/mean-stack)

Current implementation includes: 
- Ability for users to select their status

Future implementation is planned to include:
- Auto refresh 
- Login authentications
- Ability for users to create a "house", upload their own images and invite their roommates
